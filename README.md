## custom neovim config v2

okay, was following a tutorial that was using packer as the package manager and quite a lot of stuff broke unexpectedly. created a new config that uses `lazy.nvim` to install plugins.

after fiddling with vim motions and the plugins that were added, it generally feels fun (just that i haven't added any copilot, and I'm planning to keep it that way)
